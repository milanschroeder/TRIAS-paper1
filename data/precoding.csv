The poor state of certain fish stocks is, for example, a clear illustration of what I mean. The need to balance development and progress with the preservation of our marine resources and sustainability, has led us again to a clear recognition of the necessity for a comprehensive and co-ordinated approach to oceans and seas.;NA;NA

694004;The present stage of our history is marked by a seeming paradox. In the past few years, we have advanced by leaps and bounds: just think of the Euro, the Constitutional Convention, and enlargement. At the same time, indifference seems to spread among the people. Perhaps, our citizens are beginning to take Europe as a fact of life—and this is not a bad thing. But there is also the risk that they end up taking Europe for granted—and we have to prevent this from happening.;NA;NA
840833;Let us leave aside for the moment the question of whether military intervention to halt gross and systematic violations of human rights with grave humanitarian consequences can be justified. That is a debate which the European Union and the Commission will pursue vigorously.

As I said, this is both inevitable and sensible.;NA;NA

843886;1. As regards internal support, the green box has not so far been significantly called into question by any of our negotiating partners. Almost all European measures for protecting the environment through agriculture and developing rural areas currently fall into this category. We naturally, therefore, have a major stake in this situation continuing in future. With regard to the multiple roles of European agriculture, we must even consider whether we shouldn't negotiate for an extension of the green box. Animal protection, for example, is one area that could be included in the green box.;NA;NA
1644401;The European Commission has approved under the EU Merger Regulation the creation of a joint venture by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. of Japan and Siemens AG of Germany. The joint venture will be active in the field of mechanical and electrical metal plant building. The Commission concluded that the proposed transaction would not raise competition concerns as the companies' market shares are modest and a number of notable competitors remain on all markets concerned. More information is available on the Commission's competition website in the public case register under the case number M.7330 .;NA;NA
792487;However, there could also be deterioration rather than progress. Fear, feelings of a physical threat (for example, through attacks in Europe or large-scale biological or chemical hazards) could create differences. There could be major political disagreements between Member States on the course of action to take (against terrorism or in foreign policy or defence policy). An atmosphere of war usually provides fertile ground for countries to become inward-looking. The Union, which has few means of diplomatic or police action, let alone action in defence, could be discredited without having done anything wrong.;NA;NA
1705914;According to Eurostat, the first estimate for euro-zone trade with the rest of the world in July 2004 was a €12.6 billion surplus, compared with +12.9 billion in July 2003. The June 2004 balance was +9.0 billion, compared with +7.2 billion in June 2003. In July 2004, exports, seasonally adjusted, remained nearly stable (-0.1%) compared to June 2004 while imports increased by 1.3%. The first estimate for July 2004 extra-EU25 trade was a €0.7 billion surplus, compared with +2.2 billion in July 2003. In June 2004 the balance was -1.6 billion, compared with -4.5 billion in June 2003. In July 2004, exports, seasonally adjusted, remained stable compared to June 2004 while imports increased by 1.7%.;NA;NA
369658;I think this pride of being European should become a reality again. Not with arrogance. Because we have learned the hard way in Europe that arrogance does not pay off. But if we do it with some sense of modesty, that we have indeed built here one of the most important, if not the most important, experiment ever in terms of international relations - having countries united through peace and freedom - we should be proud of that as many of us felt proud when we were receiving the Nobel peace prize in Oslo some years ago.;NA;NA
346046;In this respect I would also like to announce today that with the signature of a deal on export duties by Minister Aitzhanova and by Commissioner De Gucht, Kazakhstan and the EU are concluding today their bilateral market access negotiations within the framework of Kazakhstan's accession to the WTO. The process is not over yet as Kazakhstan will have to continue negotiating with the other WTO partners but today the EU confirms that we have closed our bilateral issues with Kazakhstan and we are showing how supportive we remain of Kazakhstan's WTO accession.;NA;NA

In order to discuss Maltese science and research, he will meet the President of Malta, Dr. Abela, the Prime Minister, Mr Gonzi and Mr Pullicino, the Minister for resources and rural affairs, and organisations from the business and scientific community, notably the Board of Directors of the Malta Council for Science and technology. During his trip, Commissioner Potocnik will recall the importance of investing in R&D in order for Malta to become more attractive to researchers and to make the economy more competitive.;NA;NA
1569242;With a clean exit from the programme, Portugal will now walk with his own feet. This is not only a success for Portugal but a success for Europe. Since Portugal joined the European Union in 1986, the European Commission has always been a loyal, dedicated and constructive partner to Portugal. The European Commission has remained at Portugal's side during the implementation of the adjustment programme. Moreover, Europe has provided two-thirds of the total financial assistance granted to Portugal in 2011. The European Commission will remain at Portugal's side following its exit from the programme.;NA;NA
1585313;Agriculture is responsible for around 10% of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions. The LIFE CARBON FARMING project aims to reduce the sector's carbon footprint by 15% within six years through various low-carbon initiatives. The project team will work with the agriculture and other sectors, public bodies, private companies as well as banks, to implement carbon finance mechanisms that put a monetary value on emissions in Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Spain, France and Italy. Actions include developing assessment and carbon reporting criteria, training farmers, promoting a voluntary carbon market and networking opportunities for sharing best practice.;NA;NA
853372;Most CEECs continue to face overcapacity and restructuring problems in the processing industries. Creating market institutions, establishing marketing and distribution chains, meeting the EU veterinary and phytosanitary standards and building the administrative capacity to accompany this process are seen as the most urgent tasks to reestablish a prosperous agricultural sector and to prepare for implementing the acquis in agriculture and rural development. The private sector both domestic and foreign has and will continue to play a crucial role in this process. The governments responsibility is to create the framework conditions conducive to private sector involvement.;NA;NA
352220;"And it is why we have already managed to make good progress in the agenda set by our Innovation Union flagship initiative; be it, for instance, in agreeing on the Community patent after thirty years of negotiation, or in further reducing the innovation gap with the United States and Japan. We did it through initiatives such as the European Research Council, which has provided grants to 2600 top researchers between 2007 and 2012 and has become the reference point in frontier research; and through the European Institute of Technology, linking up business and academics through Knowledge and Innovation Communities.";NA;NA
1908052;The report also points to the need to further integrate the markets at EU level. Insufficient powers of the regulatory authorities in some Member States, inadequate capacity or inefficient use of cross-border interconnections and the vertical integration of transport, distribution and supply activities are some of the obstacles that prevent consumers from fully reaping the benefits of competition. The Commission will propose legislation later this year to strengthen the regulatory framework, notably with regard to the management of radio spectrum in telecommunications and separating the operation of energy transmission networks from generation and supply activities.;NA;NA
1717718;All the signs point the same way: we must rethink and replan. And Europe can and must play a leading role in this. That is why we have made the European Green Deal our priority. It opens up a host of new opportunities and is our new growth strategy. The headline goal is for Europe to be the first climate-neutral continent in 2050.This will require more than cutting emissions. We need an economic model that gives back to the planet what it takes away from it through a circular economy that is powered by renewable energy.;NA;NA
159399;The European Green Deal is our new growth strategy. And this time, it is a growth strategy that is not consuming – but it is a new growth strategy that is more giving back than it takes away. It is a growth strategy that is more caring. Companies from all across our continent are already turning the green transition into green opportunities and business opportunities. Some are converting plastic waste into modern furniture, for example. Farmers are using data from our satellites to adapt to climate change. ‘Made in Europe' batteries for electric cars are finally becoming reality.;NA;NA
1682021;The European Commission has granted clearance under the EU Merger Regulation to the acquisition of joint control of Univeg Holding B.V.'s flower and plant activities (Univeg F&P) by Univeg Holding B.V.

Univeg is active in the production, import, export, packaging, handling and logistics of fresh fruit, vegetables, flowers, flowers bulbs, plants and related products, and convenience food. Ciccolella and Univeg F&P grow and sell cut flowers and plants. The operation was examined under the simplified merger review procedure.;NA;NA
1556336;We have put concrete initiatives on the table and we will continue to do so. 9 million young people have already benefitted from the Youth Guarantee and we have just topped it up with additional €2 billion to help an additional 2 million. Through the European Social Fund we are allocating at least 20% to measures combating poverty and social exclusion and the Commission has put more emphasis on social priorities in the framework of the European Semester. The establishment of a European Pillar of Social Rights will also contribute to turning our agenda for social fairness into further concrete actions.;NA;NA
1231503;The European Commission has opened an in-depth investigation under the EU Merger Regulation into the planned acquisition of Austrian Airlines by Lufthansa of Germany. The Commission's initial investigation indicated that the proposed acquisition could, on certain routes, give rise to reduced choice of airline services for passengers and the likelihood of higher fares and that there are therefore serious doubts as to the proposed takeover's compatibility with the Single Market in the absence of appropriate remedies. The decision to open an in-depth inquiry does not prejudge the final result of the merger investigation.;NA;NA

1884344;Fighting terrorism and protecting public spaces: The Commission has been actively supporting Member States and local authorities in their fight against the threat posed by terrorism, among others, by better protecting public spaces. Following the discussions at the Operators' Forum, the Commission together with public authorities and private operators has identified a set of good practices to strengthen the security of public spaces. In addition, to better support the victims of terrorism, the Commission will fund a new EU Centre of Expertise – a platform for practitioners dealing with victims of terrorism – which will be set up in 2019.;NA;NA
1594024;The resulting list of critical raw materials provides a factual tool to support EU policy development. The Commission uses the list as supporting evidence when negotiating trade agreements or seeking to eliminate trade distortions. The list helps to identify investment needs, and to guide research and innovation priorities under the EU's Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe and national programmes, especially on new mining technologies, substitution and recycling. It is also relevant for the circular economy and industrial policy. Member States and companies can also use it as an EU reference framework for developing their own specific criticality assessments.;NA;NA
725113;Here again is an area where we can develop co-operation. EU labelling, production and processing methods for organic food has had a catalytic effect in increasing demand, but because we apply such high standards to our own produce, we also expect the same of imports. Only Israel has so far had its organic scheme approved by the EU, but I would encourage other countries who could also export to the EU to upgrade their standards in this respect as well. This is another point on which we could support through the exchange of experience and best practise.;NA;NA
836708;I shall leave to Neil Kinnock the honour and the task of explaining the details of the White Paper. I would like, however, to compliment him for the intelligence, enthusiasm and energy he brought to this difficult exercise, which he has carried through with invaluable support from the Task Force and the many others who worked with him on it. I would also like to thank all the staff, who by playing an active part in the broadest debate ever organised at the Commission and making invaluable contributions have shown their willingness to meet the challenge of change.;NA;NA
855050;In this connection, it does not come across as too convincing when people give their general agreement to the proposed principles of concentration, but then, when it comes to putting them into practice, call for exceptions to be made for their own country - with regard to the strict application of the 75% criterion for Objective 1 (reducing the eligible part of the population to 20%), or the Objective 2 selection criteria, for example. If we start calling into question the coherence and internal logic of the proposal as a whole, we will end up with something that is neither fair nor affordable.;NA;NA

Guarantee premiums will be charged and vary according to the risk of the loan. The premium level will cover the risks of payments and the administrative costs generated by the scheme. Consequently, the scheme should be self-financing. This measure therefore does not constitute state aid and does not threaten to distort competition in the single market.;NA;NA

1312806;Commissioner Piebalgs and Minister Bartenstein acknowledge that Russia, and Gazprom in particular, have been, and remain, a reliable supplier of natural gas to the European Union. They consider it important that this relationship is maintained, given that the EU looks to Russia for increased deliveries of gas in the future. In addition, they note their agreement that long term gas supply contracts can facilitate the very significant investments in Russia that will need to be undertaken to meet future demand. Under the EU competition rules, contracts that promote new investment and other benefits are, in principle, viewed favourably.;NA;NA
1586772;The EU Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime, adopted on 7 December 2020, allows the EU to target those responsible for, involved in or associated with serious human rights violations and abuses worldwide. This new sanctions regime covers trafficking in human beings, as well as abuses of human rights by migrant smugglers when these abuses are widespread, systematic or of serious concern as regards the objectives of common foreign and security policy. The Commission calls on the Council and the Member States to sanction migrant smugglers by transposing UN sanctions and, where appropriate, using the EU Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime.;NA;NA
457555;In October 2010 I launched Innovation Union, our ambitious initiative that puts research and innovation at the heart of the EU action to boost growth and jobs. We are making excellent progress on the 34 different commitments contained in Innovation Union, tackling problem areas such as faster standard-setting in Europe, cheaper and easier patenting, more public procurement of innovative products and services and better access to venture capital. Innovation Union dedicates an entire chapter to boosting international cooperation, recognising that working better with our international partners means opening access to our R&D programmes, while ensuring comparable conditions abroad.;NA;NA
875052;They assume, that world market prices, as they have done in the past, will continue to move downwards. They overlook the fact that the Community, with its surpluses in the 1980s, often initiated this price trend on world markets or at least supported it. The more we are forced by international agreements to desist from dumping our surplus produce onto world markets, the less will be its price effect. This phenomenon can be accurately observed through recent trends in world cereal prices. Against this background European agriculture has to re-assess world market conditions and hence its export opportunities.;NA;NA
1521214;The Commission has adopted a draft Council Decision with a view to the conclusion of a protocol of agreement between the European Union and the Czech Republic on veterinary, plant health and animal welfare measures applying to trade between the two parties. This proposal will help to arrive gradually at a harmonization of such measures, with the ultimate aim of contributing towards Czech membership in the Union. The purpose of the protocol of agreement in the intervening period until the harmonization process is complete is to facilitate trade and establish a stable framework for it based on mutual confidence.;NA;NA
1312737;The cooperation offered by some companies that provided important information for the exposure of the infringement was rewarded in line with the Commission's Leniency Notice (see IP/02/247 and MEMO/02/23). Degussa was granted full immunity from a fine which would otherwise have been €129.938 million, while Akzo/EKA, Total/Elf AquitaineArkema and Solvay had their fines reduced in return for information provided. The granting of fine reductions depends not only on the value of the information provided but also on its timing. In this case various applications were made within a matter of days or even hours from each other.;NA;NA
1299542;Secondly, building on the very successful results achieved under the 1999-2006 “EU-India Civil Aviation Co-operation Project”, Messrs.

This Joint Action Plan, which will also be finalised as a matter of priority, and a new technical co-operation programme that will start in 2007 will be important instruments in taking forward the wide range of areas of mutual interest of industry, regulators and the wider public of both sides, as identified during the aviation summit.;NA;NA
1585956;At the international level, the Basel Convention addresses the transboundary shipment of hazardous waste and certain other wastes and seeks to ensure their environmentally sound management. Under the Convention, limit values relevant to the management of POPs in waste that define “low POP content” are periodically revised and agreed, as part of non-legally binding guidelines on POPs.

1218852;A uniform application of the exemptions, in conformity with the Directive, is necessary in order to ensure equal treatment between the Member States in respect of the Communities' own resources. The Commission has questioned the Dutch legislation because it is of the opinion that the exemption of Article 132(1)(o) is being applied too widely. The Dutch 'fundraising provision' applies to organisations whose primary activities are exempt on grounds other than those referred to in the exemption provision. Furthermore, organisations that fail to fulfil the laid out under the conditions of the Directive are granted the exemption for their fundraising activities.;NA;NA

This system will enrich the market abuse supervisory toolbox in the context of the further integration of European markets. On the other hand, the proposal provides for a strengthened role for ESMA in the field of cooperation among market authorities and exchange of information. These measures will ensure greater market integrity and enhance investor confidence.;NA;NA

And their experiences feed into this network. And they in turn take what they learn – also from their fellow members of the network – back into the field. So these people are out there where it is all happening. And it is precisely this network that we will further develop and strengthen.;NA;NA

The work on anti-radicalisation will focus on early detection, resilience building and disengagement, as well as rehabilitation and reintegration in society. In addition to fighting root causes, effective prosecution of terrorists, including foreign terrorist fighters, will be essential – to achieve this, steps are under way to strengthen border security legislation and better use of existing databases. Cooperation with non-EU countries and international organisations will also be key in the fight against terrorism, for instance to cut off all sources of terrorism financing.;NA;NA

They are wrong because the situation will worsen and finally the economic basis on which they operate will break down. This is happening in North Korea and in Cuba. In African countries authoritarian rulers like President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe try to protect the privileges of a small clan. But they are on the way to wreck the whole economic structure.

It also entitles data holders to get reasonable compensation for the costs of making data available. This is fully in line with the Commission's Data Act proposal. Unlike PSR/PSD3, this proposal covers only information access services and excludes transaction initiation services, because the latter are not relevant for all types of financial services covered by this proposal.;NA;NA

1079812;The European Commission has authorised an amendment to the restructuring plan for Brodotrogir, one of the Croat shipyards in difficulty. Indeed, the distortion of competition that may arise from the modest increase in the total amount of restructuring aid is offset by the additional compensatory measures proposed by Croatia, in line with EU Guidelines on state aid for restructuring companies in difficulty. Moreover, Croatia committed to sign the privatisation contract for the yard within two weeks from the receipt of the Commission decision. This will allow the completion of the privatisation process by 1 July 2013, i.e. the date of accession of Croatia to the EU, as foreseen in the Act of Accession.;NA;NA

The level of economic activity in the EU or euro area compared to pre-crisis levels (end-2019) would be the key quantitative criterion for the Commission in making its overall assessment of the deactivation or continued application of the general escape clause. Therefore, current preliminary indications would suggest to continue applying the general escape clause in 2022 and to de-activate it as of 2023.;NA;NA

We need now to adopt a more open and transparent policy with clear rules and procedures, enabling potential economic migrants to make applications in their countries of origin based on reliable information about the conditions that will be applied to successful candidates.

1514997;"This provisional conclusion follows an examination by the Commission services of the way in which Whitbread has operated the contractual agreements with its lessees. The Commission has found that, on average, the lessees which are tied to Whitbread pay more for their beer purchases than individual operators who buy the same beer from the same brewer (so-called free traders). However, the Whitbread lessees benefit, inter alia, from lower rents, professional assistance, capital investment and bulk purchasing rebates that are not readily available to these free traders and that compensate more or less for the price differential. In those circumstances, the Commission considers that the tied lessees can compete on a level-playing field with their ""free trading"" competitors, and that an exemption consequently seems acceptable.";NA;NA
735560;The human rights' clause not only constitutes a commitment to human rights in a domestic context: it also concerns the promotion and protection of human rights at the international level. This leads me to the EU's approach to the UN Human Rights Commission. These are difficult times for the United Nations, and the CHR is no exception. The election of a Libyan Chair, Cuban membership and the rejection of resolutions on Zimbabwe, Chechnya and Sudan to which incredulity is the only sane reaction have significantly eroded its credibility. Therefore, a major challenge in the coming years is how best to organise the EU's resources political, diplomatic and financial to reinforce the international system of human rights' scrutiny and the implementation of international human rights' obligations.;NA;NA
1231074;The Commission in its Communication adopted on 13 November 2008 together with the Strategic Energy Review proposes the revision of the directive to strengthen the measures for more effective action in case of gas crisis. The January 2009 gas crisis showed that a more coordinated approach is needed on European level to provide stable and secure energy supply to European citizens. Therefore, the Commission suggests the elaboration of emergency plans to be activated automatically in case of the occurrence of supply disruption of a certain importance. A joint approach of these emergency plans is of great importance to ensure mutually supportive measures. The Commission will table in the coming weeks a new instrument proposing new measures on security of gas supply to be adopted by the Council and the Parliament.;NA;NA

For example, a consumer Ombudsman in one Member State recently found 12-year subordinated notes, carrying significant losses in case the issuer defaults, being sold to the very elderly. Risks of exiting these investments were not fully explained. In another example, a study for a consumer affairs ministry in one Member State suggested that up to 50-80% of consumers wanted to get out of long-term investments prematurely, indicating investments made were not suited to their needs. On an EU-wide level, a mystery shopping exercise on behalf of the Commission indicated that up to 60% of sales of investments could be considered unsuitable or not in the best interest of the consumer.;NA;NA

The purpose of consultations is a thorough discussion of the problems identified and possible remedies. The EU invited Côte d'Ivoire to open consultations with a view to analysing the situation and discussing ways of remedying it following events in the country in 2000, notably the human rights violations observed during the transition to democracy, the lack of openness of the presidential and parliamentary elections and acts of violence.

1335400;Europe's lower performance is also related to a huge funding gap. EU countries spend on average just 1.1% of GDP on higher education, which is on a par with Japan but much less than Canada (2.5%) and the US (2.7%). If Europe were to match the total US figure, it would need to spend an additional 150 billion € each year on higher education[2]. This situation has affected European universities' performance in world-class research, with a lower share of scientific publications, patents and Nobel prizes than in the US. A major difference is that while European higher education continues to rely almost exclusively on (limited) public funds, much stronger and lasting expansion has been possible in competitor countries thanks to a greater diversity of funding sources, with much higher contributions from industry and households.;NA;NA

1295198;Overall, the programme is broadly consistent with a correction of the excessive deficit by 2007, subject to the full and effective implementation of the 2007 budget. After 2007, the planned adjustment is in line with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact and would put the MTO within reach by the end of the programme period. However, no details on the adjustment strategy are given, which itself represents a risk for the achievement of the budgetary targets after 2007 and makes it difficult to properly assess the consolidation strategy. With a very high debt ratio, but budgetary costs of an ageing population that, conditional upon the full implementation of the adopted pension reforms, are projected to increase less than the EU average, Italy is at medium risk as regards the long-term sustainability of public finances.;NA;NA

Three aspects of the crisis have raised particular challenges for statisticians - the uncertainty over asset values, the difficulty in measuring risks which public bodies are taking on, and the rapid development of new forms of intervention.;NA;NA

932909;The scale and duration of the pandemic, and of possibly necessary future lockdown measures, remain essentially unknown. The forecast assumes that lockdown measures will continue to ease and there will not be a ‘second wave' of infections. There are considerable risks that the labour market could suffer more long-term scars than expected and that liquidity difficulties could turn into solvency problems for many companies. There are risks to the stability of financial markets and a danger that Member States may fail to sufficiently coordinate national policy responses. A failure to secure an agreement on the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU could also result in lower growth, particularly for the UK. More broadly, protectionist policies and an excessive turning away from global production chains could also negatively affect trade and the global economy.;NA;NA

766534;It is not true that Polish farmers are treated worse than their counterparts in the EU. On the contrary: the same conditions will apply to the organisation of markets from day one. Poland gets more money for rural development than the current Member States. Polish farmers' direct income support will rise from 25% to 100% in the space of ten years. The average allocation to Polish farmers over that period will be 60% of the EU average. If you set this figure of 60% against the background of the significantly lower costs in Poland and the significantly higher purchasing power of the euro in Poland compared with, say, Denmark Polish farmers are actually better off than their opposite numbers in today's European Union. That is the so-called unequal treatment. In fact Polish farmers should be keen to join the European Union.;NA;NA
840917;Let me turn to the policy side. We have made some progress in improving our environmental instruments. Legislation has been simplified and has taken into consideration the call for greater subsidiary. We have also improved the economic assessment of environmental legislation in order to ensure that our policies are cost-effective. We have improved the consultation of stakeholders in the elaboration of new initiatives, as was done in preparing the Global Assessment. Less progress has been made in implementation. This is one of the main reasons for our lack of success. The problem is well reflected in the high number of Infringement procedures against Member States.

The highest income growth was in the Netherlands, with enjoyed an increase of 17.6%, while income in France and Germany rose by 8.6 and 5.1% respectively. Among the new Member States, both Lithuania and the Czech Republic saw increases of 6.9%. Average farm income in the 'new' Member States now stands around 58 percent above the pre-accession level. The main factors behind the increase were high prices of products including cereals, oilseeds, potatoes and fruit and increased production of cattle and pigs.

1449174;Current financial regulation is still very much sector-based and addresses primarily homogeneous financial groups, namely those groups whose activities are limited either to banking/investment or to insurance. The ongoing consolidation of financial institutions, one of the most notable trends in financial markets over recent years, has led to the creation of cross-sectoral groups across the EU. Financial conglomerates hold a substantial share of the domestic financial markets in certain Member States. Some financial conglomerates belong to the biggest groups in the EU financial markets and provide financial services on a global basis. If the regulated entities in such a financial conglomerate were to face financial difficulties, these could seriously destabilise the financial system as a whole and adversely affect depositors, policy holders and investors throughout the EU. Currently these cross-sector financial groups are inadequately covered by existing legislation.;NA;NA
424;I have just talked about the images that have accompanied us in recent weeks. The situation on the battlefield in Ukraine remains difficult. It is all the more important that we do not forget what the objective of Putin's war was. When Russia invaded Ukraine just under 2 years ago, Putin and many others expected Kyiv to fall in a few days. That did not happen. Instead, the Ukrainians have recovered half the occupied territories. And Ukraine has preserved its freedom and independence. That is a major gain. Russia, by contrast, has lost many thousands of soldiers, huge amounts of military equipment and much of its political influence in the world over the past year. Putin's Russia is economically isolated and now dependent on China. Ukraine, on the other hand, is on the way to becoming a member of the European Union.;NA;NA
1292420;Secondly, the strategy suggests increasing the efficiency of gender mainstreaming in political dialogue with partner countries through the establishment of effective partnerships for a dialogue on gender and development. This includes governments, the civil society, academia and international organisations. Gender issues must also be mainstreamed more effectively in development cooperation itself. This requires that the key role of women for growth and development is better taken into account in the preparation and implementation of development strategies. To make sure that gender issues are more effectively integrated into each development project, the strategy proposes checklists to evaluate each action against its contribution to gender equality. The European Union already has a vast track-record of best practice examples for development projects addressing gender equality. The European Commission has made available for instance 2.8 million EUR per year under the thematic programme for gender equality since 2004.;NA;NA

905683;The current pro-debt bias of tax rules, where businesses can deduct interest attached to a debt financing – but not the costs related to equity financing – can incentivise companies to take on debt rather than increase equity to finance their growth. Excessive debt levels make companies vulnerable to unforeseen changes in the business environment. The total indebtedness of non-financial corporations in the EU amounted to almost €14.9 trillion in 2020 or 111% of GDP. Against this background, it is worth stressing that businesses with a solid capital structure may be less vulnerable to shocks, and more prone to make investments and innovate. Therefore, reducing the over-reliance on debt-financing, and supporting a possible rebalancing of companies' capital structure, can positively affect competitiveness and growth. The combined approach of equity allowance and limited interest deduction is expected to increase investments by 0.26% of GDP and GDP by 0.018%.;NA;NA

At sea, Ukraine has pushed back Russia's fleet and re-opened the maritime corridor to deliver grain to the world. I think this is completely underreported. In the air, Ukraine has become incredibly effective at shooting down Russian missiles and drones. And on land, Ukraine is imposing massive losses on Russia.

The project aims to boost SRI uptake in Europe, involving stakeholders to tailor the implementation of the indicator to different national contexts. A training and certification package will be developed for SRI auditors, while a new toolkit with SRI assessment and decision support tools should promote informed decision-making on smartness upgrades.

1657644;The European Commission has authorised, under EU state aid rules and in the context of the monitoring of the KBC restructuring decision of 19 November 2009 (IP/09/1730), amendments to the KBC restructuring plan. The amendments include the introduction of an incentive structure to the asset relief measure (the State Protection Measure) to encourage KBC, subject to strict conditions, to reduce the exposure of the Belgian State to the assets covered by the portfolio. The Commission found that the amendments are likely to provide an advantage to KBC and are in line with its guidance on state aid to banks during the crisis (see IP/08/1495). In particular, the measures are well targeted, proportionate and the distortion of competition limited because of the additional commitments provided by Belgium and KBC.

The Italian authorities consider that public contracts that fall within the scope of the decree can be exempt from EU public procurement rules because of the security and confidentiality needs linked to the construction of the prisons and the urgency of the works.

437;I have given these examples because they demonstrate one thing. The future of AI is inextricably linked to the future of our democracies. And AI is currently moving faster than even its developers anticipated. Market forces alone will not mitigate risks. Voluntary agreements are good for moving forward quickly, but ultimately we need binding rules. Not Chinese rules nor rules serving the corporate interests of the tech companies, but rules that approximate our European values. Where people are at the centre. This is why the EU presented the first comprehensive law on artificial intelligence. The idea behind it is to give our companies as much freedom as possible in relation to AI so that they can carry out research and grow in Europe. But there is also a need for guardrails. The principles of our social market economy should also apply in the digital era. AI must serve humans, not the other way around.;NA;NA

With this measure, the EU provides the facility with many administrative advantages enjoyed by international organisations and therefore helps to successfully implement the infrastructure project. The ESS facility is recognised as the world’s next-generation source of neutron beams, which will allow a more detailed probing of materials at the molecular level. The centre will be a major driver for innovation in science and industry in Europe and will be useful for a range of disciplines, from the construction of industrial motors to developing proteins for medical applications.

1580024;The proposed urgent measures can be implemented by the Member States in a rapid manner, without requiring burdensome changes to their national procedures and legal systems. Some of these measures are of general nature, such as the introduction of the presumption that renewable energy projects are of overriding public interest for the purposes of the relevant environmental legislation, or the introduction of clarifications regarding the scope of certain environmental Directives. The repowering of renewable energy plants that are near the end of their economic life is also an option for increased renewable energy production with the least impact on the grid infrastructure and the environment. Other measures target specific technologies, such as solar photovoltaics. Solar energy is one of the cheapest sources of electricity available and can be rolled out rapidly, directly benefitting citizens and businesses. Similarly, a rapid roll-out of heat pumps, which often replace gas boilers, accelerates the transition away from the use of gas in heating.;NA;NA

A clear stance against Putin's war of choice, against the massacres of civilians and against the violation of the fundamental principles of the world order. And as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China has a special responsibility to uphold international peace and security. Nobody can be neutral when faced with such naked aggression against civilians. This is not a war limited to Europe, which Russia has unleashed.

And yet, we well and truly failed in Seattle. We failed, first and foremost, to put development where it belongs, that is to say at the heart of the world trading system. Furthermore, we did not manage to address the developing countries' concerns about implementation or civil society's concerns on trade and the environment. We made no headway either on trade liberalisation in the classic sense of the term or on the issues we identified in Singapore. We did not succeed in setting out convincingly the need to meet basic social standards or in reassuring the developing countries that we had no protectionist intentions. So we did not launch the negotiations or put the WTO on the necessary road to reform.;NA;NA

1143096;– The SME Envoys meet in Brussels today to shape a strategy aimed at freeing the growth potential and competitiveness of SMEs. Key elements agreed are: making it possible to start a company in 3 days for less than €100, increasing access to finance and public procurement and reducing bureaucracy, including by introducing an SME-friendly test for all new legislation at EU and Member State level. For this purpose, the European Commission and all Member States should introduce a specific SME test before any legislation is adopted. The test should ensure that no new obstacles arise that could hamper the smooth running of Europe's 25 million small businesses. Twelve countries have already made the SME test a reality, and several more are in the process of introducing it. The SME Envoys agreed to implement the above measures in all Member States by September 2012. With these measures Europe is actively strengthening the position of SMEs, which are widely viewed as critical to restoring economic growth.;NA;NA

For example, students are often prevented from exercising online their legal right to enrol at any universities across the EU, because national electronic ID systems are not recognised abroad. Businesses often struggle to participate in public tenders across borders even when they are well qualified to carry out the work. ""We are imposing extra frustrating obligations on citizens. We are imposing extra barriers on businesses who want to expand within the single market. And we are imposing extra costs on public authorities.""

Our own scientific and economic committee is currently evaluating the ICES advice and will give its own opinion on 11 November.

1532590;And my final point is that the greatest potential for energy in the European Union is in our own hands. We must scale up and accelerate the deployment of renewables. We must go big and we must be fast. With the right policies in place, we can even double the capacity of renewable energy that we will add to the market next year. And the case has never been stronger. In 2022, we had record additions of wind and solar capacity in the European Union. And we expect renewable capacity to rise even further in the coming year, replacing around 12 billion cubic metres of gas. And you are showing us with your additional measures that we can add an additional 7.5 billion cubic metres. So, if you look at the overall scope: efficiency, savings, joint purchasing, renewables – this might be the mixture we need to make up for the missing gas next year. We have taken the action that is necessary. Our proposals are now on the table.;NA;NA
578150;This is not to argue that Europe as a whole has struck the right balance. Some European social models meet these criteria for active and flexible support, but many still strengthen the position of labour market insiders over outsiders. They make it difficult to expand businesses and provide little encouragement for women or older people to enter or remain in the workforce. We still invest too little in innovation and research. It is also important to be clear: this argument for greater reduction of economic risk in our societies is not an argument for state socialism, direct market controls, import barriers and national ownership or direction of industry. But the state has to have a defining role in the global age in ensuring that lives of greater economic change are not lives of ever greater insecurity. This needs to be the new point of departure for thinkers on the centre right as much as the centre left. Protective states do not have to be protectionist ones.;NA;NA

In other words: When we say that the settlement process is Cyprus driven, we mean that it is for the parties to decide on the content of the settlement. However, this should not be misinterpreted in such a way that the parties may decide not to solve the issue. The status quo, the state of non-solution, is not acceptable; it can not be an option.

1616268;The Commission assessed the measure under EU State aid rules, in particular under Article 93 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and the 2008 Commission Guidelines on State aid for railway undertakings. The Commission found that the measure is necessary and proportionate to promote the use of rail transport, which is less polluting than road transport and contributes to reducing road congestion. The measure will therefore be beneficial both for the environment and for mobility. Furthermore, the Commission found that the aid will have an 'incentive effect' as the beneficiaries would not carry out the shift to the same extent in the absence of the public support. The Commission therefore concluded that the measure will contribute to facilitating the shift of freight transport from road to rail, in line with the objectives of the EU Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy and of the European Green Deal, without unduly distorting competition in the Single Market. On this basis, the Commission concluded that the measure is compatible with EU State aid rules.;NA;NA

553722;"The management of offshore funds is an important feature of the hedge fund and private equity business models. The proposal will provide a safe and secure framework for it to continue. It will provide an ""EU passport"" for the marketing of those third country funds which comply with stringent requirements on regulation, supervision and cooperation, including on tax matters. However more time will be needed to do the necessary preparation and groundwork to make this a success. Therefore the rules allowing the pan-EU marketing of third country funds will come into force 3 years after the rest of the Directive. In the meantime third country funds will continue to be sold in those Member States which currently allow that. We are sending an important political signal to offshore centres. There will be a strong incentive in the years ahead for the jurisdictions and managers concerned to deliver the necessary improvements in supervision, cooperation with European supervisors and compliance with the OECD Tax code. This approach is consistent with the objectives of the G20 to enhance the transparency and the quality of regulation in offshore financial centres.";NA;NA
877544;"Globalisation has also raised the question of how a global economic environment will affect national or regional cultural and social values. At the most general level concerns are expressed that the global economy will produce an inevitable erosion of cultural differences and the gradual spread of a single global culture. This argument requires close examination. I see no inherent reason why the opening of the world economy need undermine diverse social and cultural values. But of course it does involve change. If the economic conditions of life in different parts of the world become more equal, this is likely to be reflected in a greater similarity of lifestyles. Also, in a global economy our cultures will be increasingly exposed to one another, but I see no reason to believe that this should necessarily have destructive or negative consequences. On the contrary, such interchange can be enriching for all of us, provided we have sufficient confidence in our culture and respect for other cultures; and provided we give them expression in ways which can be perfectly legitimate and in no way inconsistent with globalisation of the international economic system.";NA;NA
86344;Whether it is on health, infrastructure development, climate change or digitalisation, the world needs to work together to get things done. There have been many successes in the last year, not least the historic agreement signed by some 130 countries to make the global tax system fairer. But we should also not shy away from where there have also been difficult moments for global cooperation which have a profound impact on our Union. This only reinforces the need for Europe to focus on making itself stronger, both to be a better partner but also to be able to better protect our own interests and values. This is why we have stepped up our work to give ourselves the instruments to do that. We will soon present a new tool to dissuade others from using coercion tactics against us. This will equip us with the tools to take trade, investment or other restrictive measures towards those putting undue pressure on us. We are also strengthening our partnership with NATO on security and defence. I recently travelled to the Baltics with Secretary-General Stoltenberg and we are working closely on an EU-NATO Joint Declaration.;NA;NA
1470771;The commitments given by VEBA/VIAG and RWE/VEW ensure that the main links between the two big groups will be severed, especially as a result of the sale of their holdings in the east German interconnected company Vereinigte Energiewerke AG (VEAG) and the lignite producer LAUBAG. VEAG will thus become independent of the West German interconnected companies, and will have to be taken seriously as a competitor. VEAG will have a market position comparable to that of VIAG before the merger, and will become the third force on the German market, the fourth one being the southern company Energie Baden-Württemberg (EnBW). The sale of these holdings will at the same time reduce the market positions of VEBA/VIAG and RWE/VEW, to whom VEAG belonged until now. VEBA/VIAG and RWE/VEW have also undertaken to buy electricity from VEAG through their east German regional suppliers for a transitional period of seven years. With guaranteed sales volumes of over 50%, and the sell-off of the regional supplier in Saxony, Energie Sachsen Brandenburg AG (envia), which belongs to RWE, VEAG is assured of being able to supply 75% of its present volumes.;NA;NA
1503853;Under the scheme the manufacturers have undertaken that, by 1 January 2000, the TVs and VCRs that they sell will consume no more than 10 W when in stand by mode and that the average power consumption of all TVs and VCRs that they sell will be no more than 6 W in stand by mode. Such an agreement to act in a co-ordinated way is a restriction of competition, and falls under the prohibition of Article 85(1) of the EC Treaty. However Article 85(3) provides that the Commission can exempt an agreement from this provision where it meets certain conditions. These conditions are that the agreement contributes to technical and economic progress, that its benefits be shared with consumers, that competition not be eliminated in the sector and that the restrictions of competition are indispensable to achieving the benefits of the agreement. The energy saving and environmental benefits of this scheme clearly represent technical and economic progress, and by their nature are passed on to consumers. The Commission was also satisfied that competition would not be eliminated in the affected markets and that the restrictive effect of the scheme was essential to achieving its full benefits.;NA;NA

1687312;The European Commission has published its preliminary report on the competition inquiry into the pharmaceutical sector, which finds that competition in this industry does not work as well as it should. According to the preliminary findings there is evidence that originator companies have engaged in practices with the objective of delaying or blocking market entry of competing medicines. Practices vis-à-vis generic companies include multiple patent applications for the same medicine (so-called patent clusters), initiation of disputes and litigation, conclusion of patent settlements which constrain market entry of generic companies and interventions before national authorities when generic companies ask for regulatory approvals. Where successful, these practices result in significant additional costs for public health budgets – and ultimately taxpayers and patients – and reduce incentives to innovate. The report takes a sample of medicines that faced loss of exclusivity in the period 2000 to 2007 in 17 Member States and estimates that additional savings of around € 3 billion would have been possible on that sample over this period if generic medicines had entered the market without delay. The report also finds that companies applied defensive patenting strategies, primarily aimed at blocking competitors in the development of new medicines.;NA;NA

1327466;In the absence of clear-cut evidence on their impact and following consultation with stakeholders, the Commission proposes, in a Communication issued today, the temporary retention of the current restrictions on access to two fishing areas known as the Shetland Box and the Plaice Box (see attached maps). The conditions on access to these areas for some categories of vessels would remain until further evaluation is carried out as to their beneficial impact on the fish stocks concerned. In the case of the Shetland Box, the Commission proposes to keep the measures in place for a further three years. For the Plaice Box, however, no date has been set as there is uncertainty over the length and extent of the study needed, given differing views among stakeholders on what should happen next. The Commission recommends, however, that enforcement of the rules on access to the Plaice Box be strengthened to ensure their effectiveness. In tabling this Communication, the Commission fulfils an obligation laid out in the 2002 basic Regulation on the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), requiring it to assess the justification for restrictions on access to waters and fish resources beyond Member States' 12-mile coastal bands and, if required, to propose adjustments to those restrictions.;NA;NA
552587;WestLB was one of the first banks to be affected by the sub-prime crisis, months before the collapse of Lehman brothers. In April 2008, it benefited from state aid in the form of a risk shield on a portfolio of roughly € 23 billion. It soon became clear that the bank was endangered by its Investment Management activities and had to re-think its business model. For more than one year, WestLB has been looking for a partner to secure its viability. Germany had committed to find one by the end of 2008. The Commission granted an extension of three months. Faced with a deadlock, the Commission worked closely with the German authorities, WestLB's top management and owners to look for an alternative route. As a result, a new restructuring plan was notified, which tries to take the issue of long-term viability seriously. The restructuring plan approved today is about ensuring that the viable parts of WestLB will be preserved, in the best interests of West LB's owners, personnel, and ultimately tax payers. First, the bank will focus on less risky activities. The rest will be divested, reducing the size of the bank by half. In particular, WestLB's Investment Management activities will be brought to an end.;NA;NA

1595680;The Commission issued the first such list in 2016, and updated it subsequently over the past years. Since the adoption of the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, the criteria by which a third country is assessed have been extended substantially, thereby requiring the Commission to carry out an autonomous assessment. This required an adaptation of the listing process based on a refined methodology. This also follows calls from the European Parliament to have an autonomous list. Today, the Commission has amended the list of high-risk third countries, via a Delegated Act, in order for it to be better aligned with the lists published by FATF. This update is necessary since the EU list has not reflected the latest FATF lists adopted since October 2018. Further updates will take place once the Commission has engaged with third countries subject to the EU's autonomous assessments, according to the refined methodology published today.Given the Coronavirus crisis, the date of application of today's Regulation listing third countries – and therefore applying new protective measures – only applies as of 1 October 2020. This is to ensure that all stakeholders have time to prepare appropriately.

1687456;Today, the European Commission adopted its annual proposal on next year's guide prices for fresh and frozen fisheries products as well as the EU producer price for tuna for processing. The Commission proposes to decrease guide prices for the majority of white fish species, by between –0.5 % and –1.5 %. The market for white fish deteriorated in the first half of 2008, with considerable drops in prices. The market for small pelagic species has improved, and an increase of 0.5 % to 2 % is proposed, except for mackerel and Spanish mackerel (decreases of between –1.5 % and –2 %). For crustaceans there are increases for shrimps and prawns (between 0.5 % and 3 %) but decreases for crab and Norway lobster. For frozen products, the prices have tended to decrease over the past year following decreasing prices on the international markets. The Commission proposes decreases of between –1 % and –3 %. Finally, the Commission proposes to increase the EU producer price for yellowfin tuna by 2 %. The Commission proposals are based on Member States' average market prices over the previous three years. Other important factors also taken into account include trends in production and market demand, the interests of consumers and the need to avoid withdrawals of fisheries products from the market.

Up to now, EU rules on Timeshare have given consumers basic rights with regard to clear information, the right to withdraw and change their mind, and a ban on deposits. The new Directive which the European Parliament voted in favour of today, aims to tackle loopholes in the current rules. Most importantly, it will extend the scope of the 1994 EU Timeshare Directive to cover new products which have emerged on the market – like discount holiday clubs, and ""timeshare-like"" holidays on cruise boats, canal boats and caravans.

This is what is happening for example in my own area of work, with the first of the Treaties which I mentioned at the start, the one which created the European Coal and Steel Community, the ECSC Treaty which laid the foundation for the entire subsequent legal system, which basically kept to the text signed in 1951 apart from minor changes such as giving the name ""Commission"" to the body which up to then had been very appropriately called the ""High Authority"". More generally, there can be no doubt that the absence of a common energy policy is one of the gaps in the European system, a void which the national governments have perpetuated in spite of the Commission's proposals and which has been filled by valuable but sectoral initiatives like the electricity, gas and renewable energy Directives, founded perforce on the principle of protecting competition in a single market. Well, we have to face it: one of the Commission's obligations as guardian of the Treaties is to remind the Member States that the Treaty which set up the ECSC will be expiring in only two years' time, on 25 July 2002, since Article 97 says that it is concluded for a period of fifty years from its entry into force.";NA;NA

In particular, the Day's activities will focus on UN Standard Rule 18, which seeks to extend the part played by disabled people in decision-making and policy formulation. ""There is no doubt that we've seen in recent years the emergence of a more coherent European strategy for equality of opportunity and non-discrimination,"" said Social Affairs Commissioner Padraig Flynn, ""a strategy that has received a further boost just over a week ago at the Jobs Summit, when European leaders, in defining EU-wide employment guidelines for Member States, agreed to pay particular attention to the problems of people with disabilities in trying to take part in working life. This important development comes at the end of a very good year for disability issues at EU level: 1997 saw the beginning of the practical implementation of the Council Resolution on equality of opportunities for people with disabilities, the insertion in the the Treaty of Amsterdam of an anti-discrimination clause and of an Employment Title which will have major policy implications for disabled people, and a Declaration to the Final Act stating that future Internal Market measures must take into account the needs of people with disabilities - to name but some of the most significant.""";NA;NA

The SMP Guidelines set out principles for use by the national telecoms regulators under the European regulatory framework for electronic communications in relation to market-based analysis and assessment of significant market power, to guide regulators in their decisions whether and when to intervene in markets. The update of the guidelines shall take into account changes in the telecoms markets and recent developments in regulatory and competition law.

457;But tonight, I also want to look ahead. Tonight, I want not only to speak about all that Jacques Delors has done for us but on how we can take inspiration from him. Jacques Delors presided the Commission in a period marked by tremendous geopolitical challenges: a horrific war on our continent, a structural reshuffle of the international world order and the profound European aspirations of millions at our borders. As we face today many of the same challenges, let us take inspiration from what he believed in. Jacques Delors believed in peace. He knew that an occupation could never result in a just and lasting peace. He had inherited from his father – a gravely and permanently wounded WWI veteran – the unshakable conviction that mutual respect and constructive dialogue must prevail between nations. Jacques Delors believed in solidarity. He understood – before anyone else – the absolute necessity of enlarging our Union to the East in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the Berlin wall. He understood – before anyone else – the absolute necessity of ensuring cohesion, equity and just wealth distribution among European peoples. And Jacques Delors believed in Europe. He trusted our democratic values and traditions. He trusted our way of life, our attachment to fairness and our commitment to freedom to be a unique source of positive influence in the world. And he trusted that we are never as powerful as when we act all together as Europeans, united behind a common purpose.;NA;NA

Holdings S.à.R.L., ultimately owned by Macquarie Group Limited of Australia and Swiss Life GIO II Eur Holding S.à.r.l., ultimately owned by Swiss Life Holding AG of Switzerland. SGI Italia is an independent transport system operator which owns a limited part of the Italian high pressure gas network. Macquarie is a global provider of banking, financial, advisory, investment funds and management services. In Italy, Macquarie is also active in the generation of electricity through a portfolio of wind farms. Swiss Life is active in life insurance, risk, pensions, health insurance and asset management. It also operates nine photovoltaic plants in Italy. The Commission concluded that the proposed acquisition will raise no competition concerns as the companies’ activities do not overlap. The Commission also assessed a vertical link between SGI Italia’s gas transmission activity and the acquiring companies’ electricity generation activity. The Commission found that this was unlikely to prevent competitors from accessing the gas transmission network in view of the acquiring companies' limited position in the downstream market for the production and wholesale supply of electricity. The transaction was examined under the simplified merger review procedure.

The Memorandum of Understanding commits both sides to a long-term partnership to improve cooperation on all issues of relevance - including production, innovation, trade, quality policies for agricultural products and the development of rural communities. It builds upon the Common Economic Space endorsed at the EU-Russia summit in Moscow in May 2005, which set the promotion of regulatory convergence in agriculture as one of its goals. The new arrangement will allow officials from both sides to get together whenever appropriate to discuss agricultural issues, within a new, structured framework. Russia's involvement in most of the international organisations which deal with agriculture and rural development will bring further opportunities for cooperation between the EU and Russia.

It will become obligatory from 1 July 2010 and will appear on the market over a transition period of two years. When used on a product, the organic logo indicates that the product is in full conformity with the European standard for organic farming. Together with the organic logo, as a new asset in identification of all goods there will be also the code number of the certifying body in a standardized format and an indication of the place of farming of the agricultural raw materials which compose the product. Whereas any change in the logo or its combination with other elements is not permitted, this does not exclude the association of the new EU Organic Logo with existing national or private labels. The new logo displays 12 stars in the shape of a leaf against a green flag. This “Euro Leaf” was designed by Dušan Milenković who won the EU Organic Logo competition (see IP/10/142). This design was registered by the Commission as a collective trade mark and is now at the disposal of operators. For a more detailed insight into the guidelines as well as the handling of the new EU Organic Logo a user manual will be available at www.organic-farming.eu .

It equally aims to put the EU at the cutting edge of innovation and technology through the launch of pan-European projects in these areas as spelled out in the Commission's interim report (IP/03/1321).

1634063;"Following a review the Commission today decided to continue imposing anti-dumping duties on imports of Chinese steel ropes and cables. Anti-dumping duties of 60.4% have been in place since 1999 and this is the third expiry review, extending measures at the same level for a further 5 years. As a result of a previous anti-circumvention investigation, products consigned from Morocco and the Republic of Korea are also subject to these duties.The expiry review investigation found evidence that dumping from Chinese companies would continue should measures be allowed to lapse, which would have a negative financial impact on the EU steel industry. Steel ropes and cables have a wide variety of uses, including in the fishing, maritime, mining, forestry and constructions sector. The EU market is estimated to be worth around €500 million and the EU industry is present in at least 14 Member States, including Germany, Italy, Poland and the UK.The steel sector is a vital industry for the European Union's economy and occupies a central position in global value chains, providing jobs for hundreds of thousands of European citizens. The global surplus in steelmaking capacity has driven down steel prices to unsustainable levels in recent years and had a damaging impact on the steel sector, as well as related industries and jobs. The EU is using therefore the full potential of its trade defence toolbox to ensure a level-playing-field for its producers and their ability to maintain jobs in the sector. 53 measures are now in place on steel and iron products, including 27 on products coming from China.

1633765;"As part of its ongoing move to simplify and modernise the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the European Commission has adopted new rules that will for the first time expressly allow a range of modern technologies to be used when carrying out checks for CAP payments. This includes the possibility to completely replace physical checks on farms with a system of automated checks based on analysis of Earth observation data. The new rules, which came into force this week, will allow data from the EU's Copernicus Sentinel satellites and other Earth observation data to be used as evidence when checking farmers' fulfilment of requirements under the CAP. Under current CAP rules, EU member states are required to carry out a number of checks on farms as part of the Integrated Administration and Control System, which ensures that any payments made to farmers from the CAP budget are made correctly. The new rules will allow those Member States that wish to do so to eventually replace or complement on-site checks with automated and less burdensome controls. Among other benefits, this will reduce significantly the time spent by farmers with inspectors in the field and farmers will also be able to benefit from synergies with other digital technologies, such as crop monitoring and yield forecasting, to manage their farms better. Paperwork can also be reduced through the improved automation of activity recording. Further measures aiming at simplifying and modernising the policy and its implementation for farmers and administrations will be unveiled next week as part of the proposals for the future CAP. More information on the new rules for satellite data is online.(For more information: Daniel Rosario – Tel.: +32 229 56185; Clémence Robin - Tel.: +32 229 52509)";NA;NA
1638816;"The European Union welcomes the agreement on Friday in Kigali, Rwanda, on a global phase-down of climate-warming hydrofluorocarbon gases (HFCs). These manmade substances, used mainly in refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment, are the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions. Friday's agreement represents a significant step towards implementing the Paris Agreement on climate change, which will legally enter into force next month. Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy Miguel Arias Cañete said: ""This is a huge win for the climate. We have taken the first concrete step in delivering on the promises we made in Paris last December. The global phase-down we have agreed on Friday could knock off up to half a degree of warming by the end of the century. I am proud of the role the European Union played in brokering this deal. We have shown through our own action on the hydrofluorocarbon gases that this is a fast and cost-effective way to reduce emissions."" The 197 Parties to the Montreal Protocol have agreed to bring hydrofluorocarbon gases within the scope of the international treaty that has successfully phased out ozone-depleting substances used in the same sectors. The Kigali amendment requires developed and developing countries to gradually limit their consumption and production of hydrofluorocarbon gases, with developed countries moving first. The EU and its Member States have been long-time supporters of the global phase-down of hydrofluorocarbon gases. The EU has shown global leadership through its own action. The Commission's proposal for ground-breaking legislation on fluorinated greenhouse gases was adopted in 2014 and demonstrates that the phase-down was feasible.

1618949;"The European Commission has approved, under EU State aid rules, the reintroduction of a Polish scheme compensating postal operators for the costs incurred in the provision of certain services exempted from postage fees. The measure was originally approved in April 2004, last prolonged in January 2016 (SA.42843) and expired on 31 December 2021. Under the scheme, postal operators are compensated for the provision of the following services:(i) postal services provided to blind people and their associations; and (ii) posting of compulsory library copies of specific publications sent to specific libraries, in order to facilitate the keeping of archives for the purpose of cultural heritage preservation. On 31 December 2021, Poland notified the Commission of its intention to reintroduce the scheme, with the following amendments: (i) a budget increase of €0.4 million compared to the previous scheme, and (ii) the exclusion of the exemption from postage fees of items for postal voting by disabled persons in elections of local government bodies and municipalities. The measure, with a total budget of €3.4 million (PLN 16.2 million), will be in place until 31 December 2025. The Commission assessed the scheme under the EU State aid rules, and in particular under Articles 107(2)(a) and 107(3)(d) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which respectively enable the Commission to approve State aid measures granted by Member States as social aid to consumers and cultural aid. The Commission found that the reintroduced scheme continues to be compatible with the internal market. On this basis, the Commission approved the scheme under EU State aid rules. The non-confidential version of the decision will be made available under case number SA.101365 in the State aid register on the Commission's competition website once any confidentiality issues have been resolved.

1630662;"Tomorrow, the agreement on border cooperation between the European Border and Coast Guard and Albania will become operational. This is the first agreement on operational cooperation to be signed with a neighbouring non-EU country, and also the first such agreement with an EU partner from the Western Balkans, to enter force since the launch of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency. The agreement will allow the European Border and Coast Guard Agency to carry out joint operations and deploy teams at the borders shared by Albania and the EU to help tackle irregular migration, especially in case of sudden changes in migratory flows, and cross border crime, in agreement with the Albanian authorities and the authorities of those EU Member States bordering the area of operations. The first European Border and Coast Guard teams are scheduled to be deployed at the Albanian border with Greece at the end of May. Dimitris Avramopoulos, Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship said: ""The agreement with Albania – the first of this kind with a third country – is a milestone in the EU's external cooperation on border management. We will now be able to better respond to potential migratory challenges, together. I hope it will pave the way for greater cooperation with the whole Western Balkan region. Albania has shown great commitment when it comes to cooperating on migration and border management.” Similar agreements are being finalised with North Macedonia (July 2018), Serbia (September 2018), Bosnia and Herzegovina (January 2019) and Montenegro (February 2019). Earlier this year, the European Parliament and the Council agreed to reinforce the mandate of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, including on cooperation with partner countries beyond the EU's immediate neighbourhood.

1672788;"In 3 months time, on 30 April 2011, the transitional period of 7 years to register certain traditional herbal medicinal products expires. All medicinal products, including herbal ones, need a marketing authorisation to be placed on the EU market. Although herbal medicinal products are natural, they are not automatically without risk as natural substances can be highly toxic. To protect public health, these products are covered by the pharmaceutical legislation, which aims to ensure safety, efficacy and quality. Herbal medicinal products have specific characteristics in particular a long tradition of use. Therefore, a lighter, simpler and less costly registration procedure than for other medicinal products was introduced in the legislation. With this simplified procedure, products can be registered without all the safety tests and clinical trials that a full marketing authorisation procedure entails. Instead, these tests and clinical trials can be replaced by sufficient evidence that the product is not harmful in specified conditions of use and that its efficacy is plausible on the basis of long-standing use. ""Long-standing use"" is defined as a period of at least 30 years, including at least 15 years in the European Union. The exceptionally long transitional period, which will end in 3 months from now, is set out in the 2004 Herbal Directive 2004/24/EC which amends Directive (2001/83/EC) laying out a Community Code on medicines for human use. The Herbal Directive aims to simplify the procedure to help all companies, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with placing traditional herbal medicinal products on the market. If a herbal medicinal product is not registered or authorised by 1 May 2011, the product may not be on the EU market. However, herbal products may be classified and placed on the market as food provided that they do not fit with the definition of medicinal products and that they comply with the applicable food law.

1625920;"The European Commission has approved a €107 million (DKK 800 million) Danish scheme, as well as the prolongation of a previously approved Danish measure, to help companies affected by the coronavirus outbreak pay the salaries of their workers by providing support ranging between 75% to 90% of the salary costs. The schemes were approved under the State aid Temporary Framework. The first scheme, with a budget of approximately €107 million (DKK 800 million), will be open to companies that were affected by local restrictions imposed in certain municipalities in order to contain the spread of a specific variant of coronavirus that originated from mink. The second decision prolongs until 30 June 2021 a scheme previously approved by the Commission in October 2020 under case number SA.58515, and adjusts the eligibility conditions to take into account the developments of the pandemic situation in Denmark. There is no change in the original budget of approximately €41 million (DKK 307 million). The aid scheme is open to companies that were affected by the restrictive measures put in place by the government to limit the spread of the coronavirus. The aim of both schemes is to help the beneficiaries address their liquidity needs and pay the salaries of their workers, in order to avoid lay-offs and allow them to continue their activities. The Commission concluded that the measures are necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. On this basis, the Commission approved the measures under EU State aid rules.

1627241;"The European Commission has approved a RON 4 billion (approximately €800 million) Romanian scheme to support companies affected by the coronavirus outbreak. The scheme was approved under the State aid Temporary Framework. Under the scheme, the public support will take the form of subsidised loans and State guarantees on loans. The measures will be managed by the development bank arm of Export Import Bank of Romania (“EximBank”), acting on behalf of the Romanian State and in full independence of the commercial activities of EximBank. The scheme will be open to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with a turnover of above RON 20 million (approximately €4 million) in 2019 and to large companies. The measures aim at enhancing access to financing for these companies, thus enabling them to continue their activities during and after the coronavirus outbreak. The Commission found that the Romanian measures are in line with the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework. In particular, for both measures (i) the maturity of the loans is limited to six years, (ii) the amount of the loans corresponds to the level foreseen in the Temporary Framework with regard to the liquidity needs of the beneficiaries, (iii) the loans relate to investment and working capital needs, and (iv) the Romanian authorities have put in place safeguards to ensure that the aid is effectively passed onto the final beneficiaries, for instance by requiring financing banks to maintain or improve the conditions of the loans eligible to the guarantee. The Commission concluded that the measures are necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the conditions set out in the Temporary Framework.
