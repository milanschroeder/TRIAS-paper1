The EU stands for free, rules-based trade and we must be able to address unfair subsidies and dumping with determination. The tireless efforts of the Slovak Presidency, and by Member States, have been instrumental in finding this compromise. I now hope that constructive trilogue negotiations between the Council, Parliament and Commission can start without delay.” The agreement builds on the proposal presented by the Commission in 2013 aiming at providing Europe's trade defence instruments with more transparency, faster procedures and more effective enforcement. In exceptional cases such as in the presence of distortions in the cost of raw materials, it will enable the EU to impose higher duties through the limited suspension of the so-called lesser duty rule. The October European Council asked for ""an urgent and balanced agreement on the comprehensive modernisation of all trade defence instruments by the end of 2016"", following the discussion of the Communication presented by the Commission ""Towards a robust trade policy for the EU in the interest of jobs and growth"".

The initiative, which is part of the EU's overall support to the European ecosystem of excellence and trust in AI and the Commission's European Digital Strategy, will mainly target companies in their early or growth-stage, investing in the development of breakthrough AI applications and technologies that directly complement AI, such as Blockchain, the Internet of Things and robotics. It complements and builds on EIB and EIF expertise in the sector, developed through the existing €100 million Artificial Intelligence/Blockchain pilot under InnovFin Equity and direct EIB financing for AI companies through its venture debt instrument. Thierry Breton, Commissioner for Internal Market, said: “Europe has all it takes to become a hub for cutting-edge developments in Artificial Intelligence. We have the talent and a wealth of industrial data – both of which will give us an important comparative advantage in AI if we use them wisely. We are putting a framework in place to leverage our strengths and build trust – including through clear and predictable rules. The co-investment facility announced today will further support companies so that they can grow in the EU thanks to the design and the deployment of trustworthy AI.” By collaborating with private investors, the European Investment Bank expects to support approximately 20-30 small and medium-sized companies. The new funds will be available in the EU and in Horizon 2020 associated countries and are expected to be deployed during the next four years. Additional information on the co-investment facility can be found in this EIB press release.

1635642,10,"The European Commission has found the prolongation of two Austrian schemes to be in line with EU State aid rules: (i) the first promotes a shift of freight transport from road to other types of transport, such as rail and inland waterways; (ii) the second, supports better connections between railways and transfer terminals. Both measures will support environmentally friendlier transport modes, and thus further EU environmental and transport objectives, while maintaining competition in the Single Market. According to the evaluation of the two initial schemes, the measures have effectively contributed to transferring freight transport from road to rail during the past five years. The two prolonged schemes will cover the period 2018 to 2022 and have a total budget of €650 million. The Commission concluded that the schemes are compatible with EU State aid rules, in particular the Commission Guidelines on State aid for railway undertakings.

1111605,5,"The European Commission has decided to further investigate the proposal by the Czech telecoms regulator (ČTÚ) to partially lift obligations on the main Czech telecoms operator Telefónica to give alternative operators access to its infrastructure, so they can also offer broadband. Without this access, the choice of operators offering high-speed Internet in the Czech Republic would be limited and consumers might have to pay higher prices for higher speed Internet connections. The Commission has serious doubts whether ČTÚ's proposal not to impose regulation on wholesale broadband access in municipalities where Telefónica allegedly faces more intense competition from alternative infrastructures is compatible with EU telecoms rules. The Commission also believes that ČTÚ's plans could affect trade in the EU as the conditions for access to Telefónica's copper and fibre network in the Czech Republic can determine the cost of Internet services offered by other operators in the other Member States. The Commission has therefore suspended ČTÚ's plans and started a so-called 'Phase 2' investigation.",detail/en/ip_12_588,1103,press,paragraph,en,0.03170204907655716

And as Philippe de Buck mentioned in the very interesting tables he presented, one of the problems we have is this divergence between the Member States. That is why I believe that now we have to address this in a real resolute manner. Now we have what we call the European Semester. The European Commission will come at beginning of next month with country specific recommendations, with a new system of governance that will hopefully be adopted by the Member States. In a collective, giant exercise, we hope to give precise recommendations of a binding nature to each country of the European Union, precisely recognising the differences between them. This is completely new. When you look at debt at the European level, it compares favourably to the situation in the other parts of the world. The problem is precisely the problem Philippe de Buck described in his presentation - when we see different levels of competitiveness, these create some levels of macro economic imbalances. I believe it is possible to overcome those difficulties. I do not see now in today's Europe one government that is not committed to structural reform. There are, it is true, different rhythms, different paces, but generally speaking all leaders in Europe are learning the lessons of the crisis and understanding that they need to adapt to a much more competitive environment",detail/en/speech_11_351,1531,speech,paragraph,en,0.05857415869832039

However, in reality tooth whitening or bleaching products containing levels of hydrogen peroxide higher than the maximum authorised concentration are being used widely. The new Directive sets out differentiated rules according to the level of hydrogen peroxide in line with the advice from the European Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety. Tooth whitening or bleaching products containing up to 0.1% hydrogen peroxide will continue to be freely available to consumers on the market. Products containing concentrations higher than 0.1% and up to 6% will only be sold to dentists. For each cycle of use of the product, the first use will be by a dentist who will have performed a clinical examination. The dentist will then provide access to these products for the remainder of the cycle of use. Persons under 18 years of age will not be allowed to use these products, even under the supervision of a dentist. Products containing more than 6% are banned.

President Juncker held a press conference with President of the European Council Donald Tusk, Ireland's Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier. President Juncker said: “What we have agreed on is much more than a deal, it is a legal text, which provides legal certainty to the problems created by Brexit. The text we agreed on protects the rights of our citizens and it protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland. Fundamentally, today's deal is about people and peace.” Leaders then discussed relations with Turkey and the perspectives of EU enlargement. Conclusions can be found here and here. Today, leaders discussed the EU's next long-term budget and climate change. President-elect Ursula von der Leyen, who had been invited to attend the European Council meeting, presented the priorities of the new Commission. President Juncker held today a joint press conference with President Tusk during which he said: “It is an historical error not to open accession negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania […] On the next EU long-term budget, I reminded leaders that they have to conclude this debate quickly.

Andrus Ansip, Vice-President for the Digital Single Market said: ""I am happy that this grassroots movement has grown so popular, especially since coding is becoming increasingly important in today's world. Confidence and creativity in using digital technologies are essential for everyone in Europe to participate fully in our digital society. Moreover, basic coding skills will most likely become indispensable for the future jobs."" The Commission supports EU Code Week and other initiatives to improve digital skills in Europe as part of the Digital Single Market strategy. Stepping up Europe's digital skills is also part of the EU-wide Skills Agenda. EU Code Week aims to show that anyone can create and build things with code. The goal is also to get more people to learn computational thinking and understand how computers work and to connect different groups to offer more coding opportunities. Participation in EU Code Week is open to all, encouraging people additionally to organise their own coding events with the help of online toolkits, lesson plans and guides available on the EU Code Week website.

Through this call, which is part of the Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2018-2020, the most rigorous research teams in Europe are encouraged to join forces to tackle major scientific and technological challenges, hampering the deployment of AI-based solutions. It has two parts: the first part aims to bring leading researchers together in European networks of excellence centres that will work on key AI topics. Each network of researchers will choose an important scientific or technological challenge with industrial relevance to work on. The second part aims to foster coordination and exchange among the selected projects, and other relevant initiatives. Priority is given to the development of PhD programmes, the integration of AI in curricula (including in non-digital courses) and the organisation of internships. Moreover, enhanced cooperation with the industry is expected to foster an ecosystem of research and development resources as well as expertise and infrastructure in areas such as supercomputing, robotics equipment and Internet of Things. Candidates can submit their proposals until 13 November 2019. Today's call follows the recent announcement of the €20 million investment for the creation of the AI4EU, an online platform that allows the exchange of AI tools and resources across Europe, in line with the European AI Strategy.

378673,23,"We are at the turning point and all turning points in history: our fraught with uncertainty and anxiety, angst. This in Europe is now reinforced, of course, by the social problems that we have in so many of our countries, namely the tragedy of unemployment, specifically youth unemployment. Europe has been seriously hit by a financial, economic and social crisis, which became indeed a crisis of confidence. If you want to be honest, it is not just about Europe, it is about leadership in general. It is the way people look at the European institutions, certainly, but also look at national governments, look at national politicians, look at some elites, including by the way, the financial elite, because people have lost confidence in the so-called elites. And this is why it is important more than ever, to listen to people, as we have discussed today. We are asking people to contribute. We are asking, as Olafur Eliasson put it yesterday, we are asking an effort. An effort of people to contribute. And we should also make the effort of listening. Listening to citizens (as we have been doing all over this year with the European year of citizenship), but listening also to men and women of culture, to men and women of science. First of all because of a very pragmatic reason: it is that they have more credibility than politicians today. Because our publics in general are very much disappointed when they see that politicians, be it at national or European level, are indeed in difficulties to find convincing responses. So we need our friends from the cultural and scientific fields to come to discuss with us. Not because culture or science are an instrument, but because they can illuminate us in this very important and challenging moment You know, and I have said it already in Warsaw, that for me, culture or science are not instruments for some kind of objective; of course, they can help our sustainable- growth, certainly. But culture and science are ends in themselves, in the sense that they are the best ways we have to fulfil our dreams, for the improvement of persons. - Apart from, let's say, the more intimate aspects of our lives, what has to do with spirituality, or with friendship or love;- in the public sphere, it is from knowledge and art, culture and science, that men and women can fulfil their dreams.

1376572,4,"""Smoking can cause a slow and painful death"" is one of the 14 health warnings used on tobacco packages in the EU for which the European Commission is now seeking colour photographs and illustrations for cigarette packs. The Commission has adopted a Decision which opens the way for Member States to use such pictures as part of the obligatory health warnings on tobacco products from 1 October 2004 on. It also lays down the conditions under which they may be used. The Commission Decision is a follow-up to the 2001 Tobacco Products Directive (see: IP/01/702) which already makes it obligatory to enlarge the size of health warnings on tobacco packages: from 30 September 2003 on, they have to take the form of large black on white text covering at least 30% of the front of the cigarette pack and at least 40% of the back. However, the next step to use picture warnings will not be compulsory. Third countries such as Canada and Brazil already use hard hitting photographs, such as dying cancer patients or diseased lungs, to illustrate their mandatory health warnings. During the negotiations on the 2001 Directive, several EU Member States and many Members of the European Parliament advocated the introduction of graphic health warnings in Europe. As the Commission is responsible for setting up a central EU library of colour photographs and other illustrations from which Member States will be able to choose, the Commission has also launched a tender inviting interesting parties to create and pre-test the respective images.",detail/en/ip_03_1213,1533,press,paragraph,en,0.01266401913017034

The scheme was approved under the State Aid Temporary Crisis Framework, adopted by the Commission on 23 March 2022, based on Article 107(3)(b) TFEU, recognising that the EU economy is experiencing a serious disturbance. Under the scheme, the aid will take the form of direct grants. The measure will be open to certain self-employed workers and private companies legally constituted in Spain, irrespective of their size, which are active in the road freight and passengers transport sectors and that are affected by the current geopolitical crisis. The Commission found that the Spanish scheme is in line with the conditions set out in the Temporary Crisis Framework. In particular, the aid (i) will not exceed €400,000 per beneficiary; and (ii) will be granted no later than 31 December 2022. The Commission concluded that the scheme is necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, in line with Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the conditions set out in the Temporary Crisis Framework. On this basis, the Commission approved the scheme under EU State aid rules. More information on the Temporary Crisis Framework and other actions taken by the Commission to address the economic impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine can be found here.

The report shows the GDPR has met most of its objectives, in particular by offering citizens a strong set of enforceable rights and by creating a new European system of governance and enforcement. The GDPR proved to be flexible to support digital solutions in unforeseen circumstances such as the Covid-19 crisis. The report also concludes that harmonisation across the Member States is increasing, although there is a certain level of fragmentation that must be continually monitored. It also finds that businesses are developing a compliance culture and increasingly use strong data protection as a competitive advantage. The report contains a list of actions to facilitate further the application of the GDPR for all stakeholders, especially for Small and Medium Sized companies, to promote and further develop a truly European data protection culture and vigorous enforcement. Věra Jourová, Vice-President for Values and Transparency, said: “Europe's data protection regime has become a compass to guide us through the human-centric digital transition and is an important pillar on which we are building other polices, such as data strategy or our approach to AI. The GDPR is the perfect example of how the European Union, based on a fundamental rights' approach, empowers its citizens and gives businesses opportunities to make the most of the digital revolution. But we all must continue the work to make GDPR live up to its full potential.”Didier Reynders, Commissioner for Justice, said: “The GDPR has successfully met its objectives and has become a reference point across the world for countries that want to grant to their citizens a high level of protection. We can do better though, as today's report shows. For example, we need more uniformity in the application of the rules across the Union: this is important for citizens and for businesses, especially SMEs. We need also to ensure that citizens can make full use of their rights. The Commission will monitor progress, in close cooperation with the European Data Protection Board and in its regular exchanges with Member States, so that the GDPR can deliver its full potential.” The full press release, the factsheet and the Questions & Answers are available online.

In addition to these grants, 15 projects located in 10 EU Member States and Norway will benefit from project development assistance worth up to €4.4 million, with the aim of advancing their maturity. Executive Vice-President Timmermans said: “With today's investment, the EU is giving concrete support to clean tech projects all over Europe to scale up technological solutions that can help reach climate neutrality by 2050. The increase of the Innovation Fund proposed in the Fit for 55 Package will enable the EU to support even more projects in the future, speed them up, and bring them to the market as quickly as possible.” A press release is available online.

1621134,1,"Today, the Commission proposes a comprehensive set of measures to ensure the EU's security of supply, resilience and technological leadership in semiconductor technologies and applications. The European Chips Act will bolster Europe's competitiveness, resilience and help achieve both the digital and green transition. Recent global semiconductors shortages made more evident the extreme global dependency of the semiconductor value chain towards a very limited number of actors in a complex geopolitical context. But it also illustrated the importance of semiconductors for the entire European industry and society. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said: “The European Chips Act can be a game changer for our global competitiveness. In the short term, it will increase our resilience to future crises, by enabling us to anticipate and avoid supply chain disruptions. And in the mid-term, it will help make Europe an industrial leader in this strategic market. With the European Chips Act, we are putting out the investments and the strategy. But the key to our success lies in Europe's innovators, our world-class researchers, in the people who have made our continent prosper through the decades”. The European Chips Act will ensure that the EU has the necessary tools, skills and technological capabilities to become a leader in this field beyond research and technology in design, manufacturing and packaging of advanced chips, to secure its supply of semiconductors and to reduce its dependencies. The main components are a Chips for Europe Initiative, a new framework to ensure security of supply, a Chips Fund to facilitate access to finance, a coordination mechanism between the Member States and the Commission for monitoring the supply of semiconductors, estimating demand and anticipating the shortages. Together with the Chips Act, the Commission is publishing a targeted stakeholder survey in order to gather detailed information on current as well as future chip and wafer demand. Also today, the Commission and the European Investment Bank group signed a joint statement on boosting investments in semiconductors in the context of the Chips Act package, which is available online. For more information, please find the press release, a Q&A, a web-accessible factpage and factsheet.

While the EU and many other Paris Parties have increased the ambition of their targets in time for COP26, the latest UNFCCC Synthesis Report concludes that the global community is still far off the pathways necessary to limit global warming to 2°C and to keep 1.5°C within reach.

This will considerably simplify and speed up the EU consultation mechanism. To further streamline the process, the Recommendation also invites national regulators to submit their market analyses together with the proposed remedies instead of separately, as it is already best practice in most EU Member States.

His meetings with representatives of the national and regional authorities and those of the fisheries and aquaculture sector as well as shellfish gatherers in Madrid, Andalusia and Galicia had allowed him to hear at first hand the concerns and suggestions for the future of Spanish fisheries, Dr Borg said. In response to questions on the proposed European Fisheries Fund for the 2007-2013 period, he said that aid would be available for vessel modernisation to upgrade safety, hygiene and living conditions on board but ruled out a return to helping the building of new vessels which had contributed to fleet overcapacity and overfishing. On joint ventures, Dr Borg said that while they can have a role to play, their creation should not depend on public aid. He reaffirmed the Commission's commitment to renewing existing fisheries agreements and to seeking to conclude new ones with countries which saw mutual benefit in doing so. With regard to Morocco, Dr Borg said that the Commission would shortly have contacts with Morocco to assess the possibility of talks with this important partner with a view to concluding an agreement in fisheries. It had to be kept in mind that it was, of course, for Morocco to decide whether it was willing to explore such a possibility.

First, we must look at how we can make our frameworks more predictable and simple. Europe has built a very sophisticated system. But businesses today want simple and predictable rules. We have built a very precise system. But businesses today want state aid rules to be predictable, above all. We are very careful to avoid distortions in our Single Market. But we must also be responsive to the increasing global competition on clean tech. If you look at the IRA, it invests right along the value chain in some strategic sectors. But this is not always the case for our state aid. Our Important Projects of Common European, IPCEIs, for instance, aim to bring breakthrough technologies from the laboratory to their first industrial deployment. But we will also take a fresh look at how we support the whole value chain, down to the mass production of the most strategic green-tech solutions and clean end-products, including through public investment.

This will be achieved by improving the tax-collection system, general reduction of the tax burden within the restrictions of the balanced budget, development of a tax legislation compliant with the acquis, sector neutrality and equal treatment of the taxable persons.

1629703,2,"Today, with the Commission's support, Eurojust, the EU's agency on judicial cooperation, has launched a Counter-Terrorism Register, which will help EU countries exchange information on terrorist offences in a quick, efficient and uniform manner. Member States already share information with each other on the suspects of terrorist offences who are under criminal investigation or prosecution in their countries. The new Counter-Terrorism Register launched today will enable them to do so more efficiently and effectively, as Eurojust will be able to better detect links between terrorist cases in different Member Statesand provide timely and proactive feedback to national authorities as well as follow-up measures needed. Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality Věra Jourová said: “Eurojust plays a key role in supporting the fight against cross-border crime and terrorism. Fast exchange of data can make or break effective investigation and this new tool will put Eurojust on stronger footing to protect Europeans against terrorism.” Speaking at today's official launch of the Register, Commissioner for the Security Union, Julian King said: “The new Counter-Terrorism Register will help judges and prosecutors to proactively establish links between cases to ensure that criminals and terrorists do not go unpunished. This new tool is yet another building block in our Security Union.” Following the terrorist attacks in France in November 2015, France, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands took the initiative to set up a register at Eurojust. Today's Register is a result of Eurojust developing this initiative into a tool available to all EU countries. The press conference from the official launch is available on EbS+. For more information, see the press release from Eurojust and information from the European Commission on judicial cooperation and fighting terrorism.

While this preoccupation is a legitimate one, it may be worthwhile pointing out that at an estimated 1.2 percent in 1998, the EU's reported current surplus remains relatively moderate when compared to the current account imbalances of about 3 percent of GDP seen in the United States and Japan. Moreover, the Commission estimates that statistical problems in the reporting of intra-EU trade are contributing to overestimate the EU's current account surplus by between ½ and 1 percentage point of GDP. Also, whereas the United States deficit and Japanese surplus in the current account further increased in 1998, the EU surplus began to decline in 1998 and is expected to continue to do so in the coming years, as domestic demand in the EU recovers. The strong increase in EU imports from the Asian countries and Japan since the onset of the crisis provides further evidence of the contribution of the EU to the current-account adjustment efforts.",detail/en/speech_99_65,1126,speech,paragraph,en,0.03605416789650917

In fact, in extreme cases the total value of a cross-border inherited asset might even have to be paid in tax, because several Member States may claim taxing rights on the same inheritance or tax foreign inheritances more heavily than local inheritances. Citizens may be forced to sell inherited assets, just to cover the taxes, and small businesses may face transfer difficulties on the death of their owners. To tackle these problems, the Commission today adopted a comprehensive package on inheritance taxation.

The ship owner, Maersk, told me that, when he planned this ship, it was a bad business case. But he wanted it to try out how to decarbonise his fleet. But then, we launched the European Green Deal. So, the direction of travel in politics was clear. And all of a sudden, what appeared to be a bad business case turned into a first-mover advantage. We have seen innovations happening in Europe, which otherwise would have been much more difficult to achieve. For example, the first green steel factory. When we started the European Green Deal, Europe had none. Today we have 38. Europe is now attracting more investment in clean hydrogen than the United States and China combined. We have the first carbon capture and storage. So, our climate action is not only good policy but it is also a good business case.

The proposal covers all products, namely those made in the EU for domestic consumption and exports, and imported goods, without targeting specific companies or industries.

The majority of forced labour takes place in the private economy, while some is imposed by States.

1623902,3,"Today, the Commission launched 11 new European Partnerships together with industry, to boost investments in research and innovation and to overcome major climate and sustainability challenges, towards making Europe the first climate neutral economy and delivering on the European Green Deal. In line with the goals of the ‘twin' green and digital transition, the Partnerships will also deliver on the EU's digital ambitions for the next decade, Europe's Digital Decade. They will receive over €8 billion from Horizon Europe, the new EU research and innovation programme for 2021-2027. The total commitments, including those from private partners and from Member States, amount to around €22 billion. This critical mass of funding allows the Partnerships to pursue innovative solutions on a large scale, for example to tackle emissions from energy-intensive industries and hard-to-decarbonise sectors, such as shipping and steel-making, as well as to develop and deploy high-performance batteries, sustainable fuels, artificial intelligence tools, data technologies, robotics, and more. Pooling in efforts, resources and investments jointly and on a large scale under the Partnerships will also generate long-term positive impacts, boost European competitiveness and technological sovereignty and create jobs and growth. The Commission adopted today Memoranda of Understanding to launch the Partnerships, which will start their operations immediately. A signature ceremony for the Memoranda of Understanding will take place at the European Research and Innovation Days on 23 June. More information is available in this press release.

1673652,22,"Today, the European Union has approved a package of four strategic programmes for a total amount of €39 million in favour of Timor-Leste. These four strategic programmes are: a Support to Rural development for €23 million; a Support to Democratic Governance for €10.5 million; a Support to Non-State Actors for €4 million and, finally, a Technical Cooperation Facility for €1.5 million. Support to rural development is an imperative necessity in the country since 80% of the population is living in rural areas, with highly dependence from subsistence agriculture. The difficult access to rural areas hampers agricultural and social development. The support of the EU, for an amount of €23 million, aims at increasing agricultural productivity and improving the rural roads network, as well as other rural infrastructures such as irrigation schemes. Intervention in favour of democratic governance, totalling €10.5 million, includes specific support to the areas of Justice, Parliament, media and communication. Support to these basic democratic institutions remains a pillar for the consolidation of the organic structures of the country. The civil society will be also supported thanks to the planned intervention in the area of non-state actors (€4 million), in order to increase transparency and citizens' participation in the life of the country. Special consideration will be given to the gender and youth components of civil society. Finally, a Technical Cooperation Facility (€1.5 million) will facilitate the implementation of EU-Timor-Leste cooperation, with emphasis on capacity building.

On the eve of his trip, Commissioner Patten said, “I have followed recent developments in Sri Lanka with concern as the Peace Process has been effectively put on hold. I want to use my trip to express the continued commitment of the European Commission to the people of Sri Lanka regardless of party and group and to see for myself the chances for a speedy resolution to the current impasse.

1637496,9,"On March 15, the European Parliament adopted the new Regulation on Official Controls, proposed by the European Commission, to increase Member States' ability to prevent, eliminate or reduce health risks to humans, animals and plants. The Regulation provides a package of measures that will strengthen the enforcement of health and safety standards for the whole agri-food chain. The new rules aim at modernising and simplifying the European control system to ensure that food in the European Union is safe along the entire agri-food chain. The package that cuts down almost 70 pieces of EU legislation to 5 reduces the red-tape on processes and procedures for farmers, breeders and food business operators (producers, processors and distributors) to make it easier for them to carry out their profession. EU citizens will benefit from safer products and a more effective and more transparent system of controls along the chain.
